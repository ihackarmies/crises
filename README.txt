' 
' C.R.I.S.E.S. is a collection of five Visual Basic Scripts (VBscripts) 
' designed to retrieve pertinent system information for inventory and
' auditing purposes.
'
' C.R.I.S.E.S. can be used to target computers by computer name
' within an Active Directory (AD) environment, or alternatively, by
' IP address.  
'
' In order for C.R.I.S.E.S. to successfully retrieve information, it
' must be run using an account with administrator credentials on the
' target computer.
'
' In version 1.1 of C.R.I.S.E.S., all targets are hardcoded using
' variables of type: 'constant'.  The values of such variables may be
' at the beginning of each C.R.I.S.E.S. VBscript, and may be adjusted
' to suit specific scenarios.
'
' CHANGELOG: Ver 1.1 - added "Logged on User" as attribute within 
' 'system_<computername>.txt' report.

'
' C.R.I.S.E.S. Usage:
'----------------------------------------------------------------------
' 1. crises_enumerate.vbs //generates a file containing a listing of all
'                         //Computer objects contained within an AD OU.
'
' 2. crises_deploy.vbs    //deploys the crises_interogation script to all
'                         //computers listed in the enumeration file
'
' 3. crises_scan.vbs      //invokes the crises_interogation script on all
'                         //computers listed in the enumeration file
'
' 4. crises_report.vbs    //copies the reports generated from the
'                         //crises_interogation script to the server
'----------------------------------------------------------------------
'
' Program Flow: 
'----------------------------------------------------------------------
' The crises_interrogate.vbs script is placed on the
' target computers identified in the file generated by crises_enumerate
' by crises_deploy.  crises_scan remotely invokes the deployed
' crises_interrogate script and crises_report pulls the results of the
' interrogations from the target computers and copies them to the server.
'----------------------------------------------------------------------
'
' TODO: 
'----------------------------------------------------------------------
' Develop and implement crises_analysis script to search reports for
' unauthorized software/processes (e.g. Skype) and mandatory 
' software/processes that are missing (e.g. HBSS & STYX)
'
' Implement all hard-coded constants as variable arguments passed to
' the program at run time.
